Summary

//For my final project, I would like to explore with a heart rate pulse sensor.  Originally I had another project I wanted to do but I change my first project dealing with processing, piano keys and the xbox kinects. So for my final project, I am going to create a bracelet with a pulse sensor. I would like to use this bracelet when I’m running or heart rate is high. When bpm is high the LED will turn on.  Also with the bracelet I would like to create a visual pulse rate on processing as well. 

//Component Parts 

//Autodesk Fusion 360 (For 3D printing the bracelet)
//Neo Pixel LED lights
//Heart Pulse sensors 
//Processing

Challenges 

I feel like this whole project will be a big challenge because I have never used any of these components before. Here are the things I really feel like challenges I will face:  

1.	Learning how to 3D model/print the bracelet.
2.	Understand how to use processing and arduino together to have a visual effect. (understanding how to code everything.)
3.	Coding a visual pulse rate using processing.
4.	Probably spending most of my time coding. (Sensor & Processing)

//Timeline
//Week 1 –Research on the components and buy the parts as soon as possible. 
//Week 2 – 3d model the bracelet, play around with the pulse sensor 
//Week 3 – pulse sensor/ 3d modeling/ coding
//Week 4 – coding
//Week 5 – coding
