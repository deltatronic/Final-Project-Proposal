Debug:

3d Print
Research how to 3d model
Autodesk Fusion 360
Watch youtube videos for tutorial 
how do I convert the file to STL so I can print it. 
Research where to print out 3d prints because CCA is packed with people printing

Research out how they work together
How does the code work?

Neopixel light
How many neopixel light will I be using?
Should I use less so I can use a smaller battery?
Find how to code the behavior of my flow diagram.

How do I convert from uno to the trinket?
How do I do the wiring? 
Check adafruit for tutorial and coding. 
Trinket USb was broken so need to find another way to load the code up with an adapter piece that converts it to the uno.
