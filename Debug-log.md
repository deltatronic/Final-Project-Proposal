<b>Debug:</b>

<b>3d Print</b>

Research how to 3d model

Autodesk Fusion 360

Watch youtube videos for tutorial 

how do I convert the file to STL so I can print it. (Had to download a program called meshmixer to convert files to STL)

Research where to print out 3d prints because CCA is packed with people printing (Went on 3dhubs.com for 3d prints)

First print went wrong. I didn't shell out the model. Second print was too small to fit the neopixel. Final and third print went better because I made the bracelet wider for the lights.


<b>Battery pack:</b>

Voltage, what size to get?

USB Battery Pack - 2200 mAh Capacity - 5V 1A Output @ adafruit

USB battery Pack did not come in time so I had to buy another battery pack from amazon instead. 


<b>Sensor + lighting</b>

Wasn't sure how to put the code together for sensor and lighting

Figured out I need to use serial to put them together.

<b>Neopixel light</b>

How many neopixel light will I be using?

Should I use less so I can use a smaller battery? (Decided to use less neopixel so I dont have to use a 5v adapter.Instead use usb battery.)

<b>Find how to code the behavior.</b>

Created a flow chart to make it easier for me to write the code down.

Didn't understand how to make multiple steps to lighting. (Found out that there was something called cases where I can change the behavior depend on the situation.) 

<b>Trinket/arduino</b>

How do I do the wiring? (Read the schematic to figure out how to wire. Had some trouble with wiring because the pin in the wrong area.)

Loading code to Uno was good but when it came to the trinket it would not load. 

Found out the Trinket USB was broken so need to find another way to load the code up so I used adapter piece to converts it to the uno.
 
Code Upload and working.
